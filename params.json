It performs drug-pathay association analysis on paired transcription/drug sensitivity profile data using an efficient bi-convex optimization algorithm. For instructions on how to use this package, please refer to 'CCEL_analysis.m' and 'NCI60_analysis.m' as vignettes.\r\n\r\nIt requires the following four matrices as input: 1) An N by G transcription profile matrix Y1; 2) An N by D drug sensitivity matrix Y2; 3) A P by G pathway-gene relationship indicator matrix L1; 4) A P by D drug-pathway association indicator matrix L2_prior. N is the number of cell lines (samples), G is the number of genes, D is the number of drugs and P is the number of pathways. Of course, the samples, genes, drugs and pathways have to be in the same order across these matrices. \r\n\r\n====\r\n\r\nThis repository contains the following files:\r\n\r\niPaD.m        This is the main function of the iPaD package.\r\niPaD_cv.m     Perform cross-validation to choose an appropriate penalty parameter.\r\niPaD_permu.m  Perform permutaton test to calculate the p-values for the drug-pathway associations.\r\n\r\n(initialize_X.m LassoSolver.m update_B1.m update_B2.m update_X.m) \r\nThese files are all sub-routines of the iPaD main function.\r\n\r\nquality_control.m   Perform the two following quality control steps for the input data set: 1) remove genes or drugs that have less than three unique values; 2) merge pathways that have identical member genes.\r\n\r\nCCLE_analysis.m   Code for analyzing an example real data set - the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) data set. Can be used as a vignette for the usage of the iPaD package.\r\n(CCLE_L1.txt CCLE_L2_prior.txt CCLE_L2_validate.txt CCLE_Y1.txt CCLE_Y2.txt CCLE_genes.txt CCLE_drugs.txt CCLE_pathways.txt)\r\nThese files are the CCEL data set.\r\n\r\nNCI60_analysis.m   Code for analyzing another example real data set - the NCI-60 data set.
